                <h2>Free Shows at the Abbey</h2>
                <h3>Ireland's National Theatre</h3>
                <p class="column description-txt"> The Abbey is Ireland's national theatre, created for Ireland by W.B. Yeats and Lady Gregory in 1904. This is the gift that keeps on giving - with its Free First Previews programme, walk in to some great shows free of charge. Start queuing around 5.30pm and you should be fine. The queue starts on the left of the front entrance, and extends around the left-hand side of the building along where the Luas tracks are. Just follow the crowd. Be sure your group arrives together, as they give out flyers to make sure you've really been in the queue the whole time! The tickets are handed out at 6.30pm and the show starts at 7.30pm. With a capacity of 492, there are quite a few to go around. For more information on relevant dates take a look at <a href="https://www.abbeytheatre.ie/free-first-previews/">The Abbey</a> website.</p>

            <h3>Laugh your ass off at this hipster Gin bar</h3>
            <p class="column description-txt">For all the great comedy in Dublin at the moment, the free gigs are often something to be wary of. This gig features performers who you'll pay to see at The International, a fairly well-known pub helping to cultivate the Irish comedy scene since 1992 and host to some hilarious acts and comedy battles. </p>
